# AUDIO-SIGNAL-PROCESSING-AGENT
An AI-powered assistant built using IBM Watson Studio and Granite AI that helps design and troubleshoot audio circuits like amplifiers, filters, and preamps. It provides real-time suggestions for noise reduction, distortion fixes, and circuit optimization. 
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
**Problem No. 32 – Audio Signal Processing Assistant Agent**

In the field of audio electronics, professionals and students alike often face recurring challenges when working with analog circuits such as **preamplifiers, filters, and power amplifiers.** Common issues include signal distortion, background noise, grounding problems, and improper filter configurations. Addressing these problems typically requires domain expertise, time-consuming testing, and repeated manual adjustments.

However, with the increasing complexity of audio systems and the need for precision in design, there is a growing demand for intelligent tools that can support circuit designers in diagnosing faults and improving performance. Traditional resources like textbooks, forums, or trial-and-error approaches often fall short in delivering quick and accurate solutions.
## PROPOSED SOLUTION

To tackle the common challenges encountered in audio signal processing and circuit design, this project presents the development of an **AI-powered Audio Signal Processing Assistant Agent**.

This intelligent tool is designed to function as a **virtual assistant** for students, electronics engineers, and hobbyists, offering **real-time support** and **expert guidance** on a wide range of audio circuit issues—such as **signal distortion**, **grounding problems**, **noise interference**, and **filter misconfiguration**.

The solution will be built using the following technologies:

-  **IBM Granite AI Model** for advanced language understanding
-  **IBM Watson Studio** for development and model integration
-  **IBM Cloud Lite** for deployment and accessibility
