# PROBLEM STATEMENT
**Problem No. 32 â€“ Audio Signal Processing Assistant Agent**
In the field of audio electronics, professionals and students alike often face recurring challenges when working with analog circuits such as preamplifiers, filters, and power amplifiers. Common issues include signal distortion, background noise, grounding problems, and improper filter configurations. Addressing these problems typically requires domain expertise, time-consuming testing, and repeated manual adjustments.

However, with the increasing complexity of audio systems and the need for precision in design, there is a growing demand for intelligent tools that can support circuit designers in diagnosing faults and improving performance. Traditional resources like textbooks, forums, or trial-and-error approaches often fall short in delivering quick and accurate solutions.
